## Project Description

We chose an unfamiliar cipher, the Morbit cipher, to present to the class. We created an encoder, decoder, and visualizer.
Morbit encryption is an over-encryption of Morse code, adding polygramic substitution by fractionation.
It by first converting the text into Morse code which is written as a series of dots **(●)**, dashes **(–)**, and spaces.  To make it more convenient to solve, we typically represent the spaces as an **(×)**. A single space is used at the end of a Morse code letter and a pair of spaces is used at the end of a word.
