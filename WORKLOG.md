Fixed decoder out of bounds issue with separating words   
Fixed cut off decoded message

### 5/29

Started visualizer to see if we can display anything  
Encoder completely works with "x" acting as a separator for characters and "xx" acting as a separator for words

### 6/01

Added edge cases for punctuated plain text. When put through encoder, punctuation is removed(since it can't be converted to Morse)  
Created tryhackme room for h/w
