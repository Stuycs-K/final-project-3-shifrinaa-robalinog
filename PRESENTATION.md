# Morbit cipher
Morbit encryption is an over-encryption of Morse code, adding polygramic substitution by fractionation.
It by first converting the text into Morse code which is written as a series of dots **(●)**, dashes **(–)**, and spaces.  To make it more convenient to solve, we typically represent the spaces as an **(×)**. A single space is used at the end of a Morse code letter and a pair of spaces is used at the end of a word.

### What we're covering:
1. Encoding
2. Decoding
3. Visualization

## Encoding
1. Convert plain text into Morse code
2. Freely assign digits 1-9 to each of the 9 combinations
3. Convert Morse code into cipher text following mapping

* Randomized mapping system implementation

## Decoding
1. Acquire keyword
2. Turn keyword into number mapping system
3. Use mapping system to convert numbers into Morse code
4. Convert Morse code into plain text

## Visualization
